## Module Description

This puppet module installs and setup Apache Spark cluster, optionally with security. YARN and Spark Master cluster modes are supported.

<a name="setup"></a>
## Setup

<a name="what-spark-affects"></a>
### What spark affects

* Packages: installs Spark packages as needed (core, python, history server, ...)
* Files modified:
 * */etc/spark/conf/spark-default.conf*
 * */etc/spark/conf/spark-env.sh* (modified, when *environment* parameter set)
 * */etc/default/spark*
 * */etc/profile.d/hadoop-spark.csh* (frontend)
 * */etc/profile.d/hadoop-spark.sh* (frontend)
* Permissions modified:
 * */etc/security/keytab/spark.service.keytab* (historyserver)
* Alternatives:
 * alternatives are used for */etc/spark/conf* in Cloudera
 * this module switches to the new alternative by default, so the Cloudera original configuration can be kept intact
* Services:
 * master server (when *spark::master* or *spark::master::service* included)
 * history server (when *spark::historyserver* or *spark::historyserver::service* included)
 * worker node (when *spark::worker* or *spark::worker::service* included)
* Helper files:
 * */var/lib/hadoop-hdfs/.puppet-spark-\**

<a name="setup-requirements"></a>
### Setup Requirements

There are several known or intended limitations in this module.

Be aware of:

* **Hadoop repositories**
 * neither Cloudera nor Hortonworks repositories are configured in this module (for Cloudera you can find list and key files here: [http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/debian/wheezy/amd64/cdh/](http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/debian/wheezy/amd64/cdh/))
 * *java* is not installed by this module (*openjdk-7-jre-headless* is OK for Debian 7/wheezy)

* **No inter-node dependencies**: working HDFS is required before deploying of Spark History Server, dependency of Spark HDFS initialization on HDFS namenode is handled properly (if the class *spark::hdfs* is included on the HDFS namenode, see examples)

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

There are two cluster modes, how to use Spark (these modes can be both enabled):

* **YARN mode**: Hadoop is used for computing and scheduling
* **Spark mode**: Spark Master Server and Worker Nodes are used for computing and scheduling

Optionally **Spark History Server** can be used (for both YARN or Spark modes), which would also require Hadoop HDFS.

The Spark mode doesn't support security, only YARN mode can be used with secured Hadoop cluster.

Puppet classes to include:

* everywhere: *spark*
* YARN mode (requires Hadoop cluster with YARN, see CESNET Hadoop puppet module):
 * client: *spark::frontend*
* Spark mode:
 * master: *spark::master*
 * slaves: *spark::worker*
* optionally History Server (requires Hadoop cluster with HDFS, see CESNET Hadoop puppet module):
 * *spark::historyserver*
 * on HDFS namenode: *spark::hdfs*

<a name="usage-yarn"></a>
### Spark in YARN cluster mode

**Example**: Apache Spark over Hadoop cluster:

For simplicity one-machine Hadoop cluster is used (everything is on *$::fqdn*, replication factor 1).

    class{'hadoop':
      hdfs_hostname => $::fqdn,
      yarn_hostname => $::fqdn,
      slaves => [ $::fqdn ],
      frontends => [ $::fqdn ],
      realm => '',
      properties => {
        'dfs.replication' => 1,
      },
    }

    class{'spark':
      hdfs_hostname => $::fqdn,
    }

    node default {
      include stdlib

      include hadoop::namenode
      include hadoop::resourcemanager
      include hadoop::historyserver
      include hadoop::datanode
      include hadoop::nodemanager
      include hadoop::frontend

      include spark::frontend
      # should be collocated with hadoop::namenode
      include spark::hdfs
    }

Notes:

* if collocated with HDFS namenode, add dependency *Class['hadoop::namenode::service'] -> Class['spark::historyserver::service']*
* if not collocated, it is needed to have HDFS namenode running first (puppet should be launched later again, if Spark History Server won't start because of HDFS)
* for Spark clients (in YARN mode): user must logout and login again or launch "*. /etc/profile.d/hadoop-spark.sh*"

Now you can submit spark jobs in the cluster mode over Hadoop YARN:

    spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --deploy-mode cluster --master yarn /usr/lib/spark/lib/spark-examples-1.2.0-cdh5.3.1-hadoop2.5.0-cdh5.3.1.jar 10

<a name="usage-master"></a>
### Spark in Spark Master cluster mode

**Example**: Apache Spark in Spark cluster mode:

Two-nodes cluster is used here.

    $master_hostname='spark-master.example.com'

    class{'hadoop':
      realm         => '',
      hdfs_hostname => $master_hostname,
      slaves        => ['spark1.example.com', 'spark2.example.com'],
    }

    class{'spark':
      master_hostname        => $master_hostname,
      hdfs_hostname          => $master_hostname,
      historyserver_hostname => $master_hostname,
      yarn_enable            => false,
    }

    node 'spark-master.example.com' {
      include spark::master
      include spark::historyserver
      include hadoop::namenode
      include spark::hdfs
    }

    node /spark(1|2).example.com/ {
      include spark::worker
      include hadoop::datanode
    }

    node 'client.example.com' {
      include hadoop::frontend
      include spark::frontend
    }

Notes:

* there is also enabled Spark History Server (*spark::historyserver*), which requires HDFS (master: *hadoop::namenode*, slaves: *hadoop::datanode*)
* YARN is disabled completely, to enable YARN: include also *hadoop::nodemanager* on the slave nodes (collocation with *spark::worker* is not needed) and *hadoop::resourcemanager* on master (see previous example, or CESNET Hadoop puppet module)

<a name="usage-jar-optimization"></a>
### Spark jar file optimization

The *spark-assembly.jar* file is copied into HDFS on each job submit. It is possible to optimize this by copying it beforehand. Keep in mind the jar file needs to be refreshed on HDFS with each Spark SW update.

    ...

    class{'spark':
      hdfs_hostname => $::fqdn,
      jar_enable    => true,
    }

    ...

Copy the jar file after installation and deployment (superuser credentials are needed if security in Hadoop is enabled):

    hdfs dfs -put /usr/lib/spark/spark-assembly.jar /user/spark/share/lib/spark-assembly.jar

<a name="usage-history-server"></a>
### Add Spark History Server

Spark History server stores details about Spark jobs. It is provided by the class *spark::historyserver*. The parameter *historiserver\_hostname* needs to be also specified (replace *$::fqdn* by real hostname), and HDFS cluster is required:

    ...
    class{'spark':
      ...
      historyserver_hostname => $::fqdn,
    }

    node default {
      ...
      include spark::historyserver
    }

<a name="multihome"></a>
### Multihome

Multihome is not supported.

You may also need to set *SPARK\_LOCAL\_IP* to bind RPC listen address to the default interface:

    environment => {
      'SPARK_LOCAL_IP' => '0.0.0.0',
      #'SPARK_LOCAL_IP' => $::ipaddress_eth0,
    }

<a name="multinn"></a>
### Cluster with more HDFS Name nodes

If there are used more HDFS namenodes in the Hadoop cluster (high availability, namespaces, ...), it is needed to have 'spark' system user on all of them to autorization work properly. You could install full Spark client (using spark::frontend::install), but just creating the user is enough (using spark::user).

Note, the spark::hdfs class must be used too, but only on one of the HDFS namenodes. It includes the spark::user.

Example:

    node <HDFS_NAMENODE> {
      include spark::hdfs
    }

    node <HDFS_OTHER_NAMENODE> {
      include spark::user
    }

<a name="upgrade"></a>
### Upgrade

The best way is to refresh configurations from the new original (=remove the old) and relaunch puppet on top of it. There is also problem with start-up scripts on Debian, which needs to be worked around, where Spark history server is used.

For example:

    alternative='cluster'
    d='spark'
    mv /etc/{d}$/conf.${alternative} /etc/${d}/conf.cdhXXX
    update-alternatives --auto ${d}-conf

    service spark-history-server stop || :
    mv /etc/init.d/spark-history-server /etc/init.d/spark-history-server.prev

    # upgrade
    ...

    puppet agent --test
    #or: puppet apply ...

    # restore start-up script from spark-history-server.dpkg-new or spark-history-server.prev
    ...
    service spark-history-server start

<a name="class-spark"></a>
### `spark` class

####Parameters

#####`alternatives`

Switches the alternatives used for the configuration. Default: 'cluster' (Debian) or undef.

It can be used only when supported (for example with Cloudera distribution).

#####`defaultFS`

Filesystem URI. Default: '::default' (from *$::hadoop::_defaultFS*).

Examples:

* *hdfs://hdfs.example.com:8020*
* *hdfs://mycluster*

#####`hdfs_hostname`

HDFS hostname or defaultFS (for example: 'host:8020', 'haName', ...). Default: undef.

Enables storing events to HSFS and makes *jar_enable* option available.

#####`master_hostname`

Spark Master hostname. Default: undef.

#####`master_port`

Spark Master port. Default: '7077'.

#####`master_ui_port`

Spark Master Web UI port. Default: '18080'.

#####`historyserver_hostname`

Spark History server hostname. Default: undef.

#####`historyserver_port`

Spark History Server Web UI port. Default: '180088'.

Notes:

* the Spark default value is 18080, which conflicts with default for Master server
* no *historyserver\_ui\_port* parameter (Web UI port is the same as the RPC port)

#####`worker_port`

Spark Worker node port. Default: '7078'.

#####`worker_ui_port`

Spark Worker node Web UI port. Default: '18081'.

#####`environment`

Environments to set for Apache Spark. Default: undef.

The value is a hash. The '::undef' values will unset the particular variables.

Example: you may need to increase memory in case of big amount of jobs:

    environment => {
      'SPARK_DAEMON_MEMORY' => '4096m',
    }

#####`properties`

Spark properties to set. Default: undef.

#####`realm`

Kerberos realm. Default: undef.

Non-empty string enables security.

#####`hive_enable`

Enable support for Hive metastore. Default: true.

This just create the symlink of the Hive configuration file in the Spark configuration directory on the frontend.

There is required to install also Hive JDBC (or Spark assembly with Hive JDBC) at all worker nodes.

#####`jar_enable`

Configure Apache Spark to search Spark jar file in *$hdfs\_hostname/user/spark/share/lib/spark-assembly.jar*. Default: false.

The jar needs to be copied to HDFS manually after installation, and also manually updated after each Spark SW update:

    hdfs dfs -put /usr/lib/spark/spark-assembly.jar /user/spark/share/lib/spark-assembly.jar

#####`yarn_enable`

Enable YARN mode. Default: true.

This requires configured Hadoop using CESNET Hadoop puppet module.
